# FlyingCouch_Driver
Flying Couch Driver app will be the app used by delivery agents on the Flying Couch delivery booking platform service network.  
Drivers will be able to on the mobile platform:

1) receive notifications of delivery service requests from potential customers

2) either accept or request delivery bookings

3) organize their schedules using their route preferences

4) communicate with their customers for special bookings

5) the app will automatically inform customers of delays based on driver's schedule and GPS location tracker

6) delivery agents will be able to be paid securely via app


Delivery assignments will be prioritized to drivers with high ratings and most active delivery agents on the app.  This will incentivise delivery agents to treat customers well to receive more business on the app.
